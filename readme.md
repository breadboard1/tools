# Hacking Tools: Python Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python-based hacking tools developed for educational purposes. These tools are designed to demonstrate concepts such as network security, ethical hacking, and system vulnerabilities. Examples include:

- MAC Address Changer
- DNS Spoofer
- ARP Spoofer
- And more tools as they are added!

# ⚠️ Disclaimer:
These tools are intended for educational and ethical purposes only. Use them responsibly and only with proper authorization. Unauthorized use of these tools may be illegal and unethical.

# Tools in the Repository
- MAC Address Changer

Changes the MAC address of a device on a network. Useful for testing network security and bypassing MAC-based authentication.
- DNS Spoofer

Redirects DNS queries to malicious servers for testing purposes. Demonstrates how DNS spoofing attacks can occur and how to mitigate them.
- ARP Spoofer

Performs ARP poisoning to intercept and manipulate network traffic. Helps to understand vulnerabilities in ARP protocol and improve defenses against such attacks.
- (More to Come...)

New tools will be added as this repository evolves.
